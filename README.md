# THPSBot v3.0.3.3

## What is this!?
THPSBot is a bot for the [THPS Speedrun Discord](https://thps.run/discord). It is a bot specially designed by [ThePackle](https://twitter.com/thepackle) that combines multiple functions. This includes:
*   Periodic checks to the [Speedrun.com API](https://github.com/speedruncomorg/api) to see if there is any new games to verify in the THPS series.
*   Checks every minute to see if someone is currently streaming.
*   Public and private polls with reporting sent to the author when a set time period expires.

## Note
This bot is mostly plug-and-play. However, if you use this for your project or fork it, please know that `thpsrun.py` will not work.

If you want to assist in this project's development for the THPS Speedrun Discord, let Packle know and he can make you an API key.
